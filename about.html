    <h1>✅ About BILD</h1>

    <p><strong>BILD (British Indians Living in Dubai UAE)</strong> is a <strong>not-for-profit community</strong> created exclusively for individuals of <strong>British Indian heritage</strong> — or those married to someone who is—living in the UAE. We welcome those of <strong>Indian origin</strong> who were <strong>born or raised in the UK</strong> and identify with both <strong>British and Indian culture.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>BILD connects members</strong> through cultural celebrations such as <strong>Diwali, social meet-ups, family-friendly activities,</strong> and opportunities to <strong>support and grow British Indian businesses, professionals, and entrepreneurs</strong> in the UAE. While we <strong></strong>embrace all faiths</strong>, BILD remains centred on the <strong></strong>unique experiences of British Indians living abroad.</strong></p>

    <p>We recognise the richness of the broader South Asian community and appreciate the many other groups in the UAE that reflect different backgrounds. BILD provides a secure space for the British Indian voice and experience to thrive, and we encourage members to invite friends, enhancing the value and shared experiences within our community.</p>

    <p>To ensure smooth integration, all members are asked to introduce themselves to the group. Anonymous joiners who do not provide their identity will be removed.</p>

    <p>As a not-for-profit, all funds raised go towards organising activities, covering licensing and operating expenses, and creating more opportunities for our members to connect. Running BILD is a serious commitment that requires considerable time, energy, and financial contributions from the team. We rely on the support of members to sustain and grow the community. By attending events, spreading the word, and getting involved, you help build a space that benefits everyone.</p>

    <p>British Indian business owners or professionals interested in collaborating or sponsoring are encouraged to get in touch. The more you contribute, the more we can create for you, your families, and the wider British Indian community in the UAE.</p>

    <p><strong>Follow us on Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/BILD_AE" target="_blank">@BILD_AE</a></strong> to stay updated on events and opportunities. Together, we can strengthen our community!</p>
