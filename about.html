    <h1>✅ About BILD</h1>

    <p><strong>BILD (British Indians Living in Dubai UAE)</strong> is a <strong>not-for-profit community</strong> created exclusively for individuals of <strong>British Indian heritage</strong> — or those married to someone who is—living in the UAE. We welcome those of <strong>Indian origin</strong> who were <strong>born or raised in the UK</strong> and identify with both <strong>British and Indian culture.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>BILD connects members</strong> through cultural celebrations such as <strong>Diwali, social meet-ups, family-friendly activities,</strong> and opportunities to <strong>support and grow British Indian businesses, professionals, and entrepreneurs</strong> in the UAE. While we <strong></strong>embrace all faiths</strong>, BILD remains centred on the <strong></strong>unique experiences of British Indians living abroad.</strong></p>

    <p>We recognise the richness of the <strong>broader South Asian community</strong> and appreciate the many other groups in the UAE that reflect <strong>different backgrounds. BILD provides a secure space</strong> for <strong>the British Indian voice</strong> and experience to thrive, and we encourage members to <strong>invite friends</strong>, enhancing the value and shared experiences within our community.</p>

    <p>To ensure smooth integration, all members are asked to <b>introduce themselves</b> to the group. <b>Anonymous joiners</b> who do not provide their identity will be removed.</p>

    <p>As a <strong>not-for-profit,</strong> all funds raised go towards <strong>organising activities</strong>, covering <b>licensing and operating expenses</b>, and creating more opportunities for our members to connect. Running BILD is a <b>serious commitment</b> that requires considerable <b>time, energy, and financial contributions</b> from the team. We rely on the <b>support of members</b> to sustain and grow the community. By <b>attending events, spreading the word, and getting involved,</b> you help build a space that benefits everyone.</p>

    <p><strong>>British Indian business owners or professionals</strong interested in <strong>collaborating or sponsoring</strong> are encouraged to get in touch. The more you <b>contribute,</b> the more we can create for you, your families, and the <strong>wider British Indian community</strong> in the UAE.</p>

    <p><strong>Follow us on Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/BILD_AE" target="_blank">@BILD_AE</a></strong> to stay updated on events and opportunities. <strong>Together, we can strengthen our community!</strong></p>
